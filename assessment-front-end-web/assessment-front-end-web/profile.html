          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>I enjoy dabbling in all things music, although I can't say I'm the best with any of it though lol. I also love baking and make all of my family their birthday cakes!</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>Because I'm not the best at expanding my horizons, my interests are the same as my skills. I enjoy listening to and creating music. I also love baking and do it all of the time. I also go to concerts all of the time and it would probably have to be my favorite activity of all time!</p>
